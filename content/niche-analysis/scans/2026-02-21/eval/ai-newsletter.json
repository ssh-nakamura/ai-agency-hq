        "grok_raw": "[\n  {\n    \"text\": \"The Rundown AI is the first AI newsletter to hit $10M/year (in 2.8 years!). There are 3 things they’re INCREDIBLE at that you need to steal: Quick numbers: • 1.4M subscribers • $10M run-rate • ~$7 revenue per subscriber per year Most AI newsletters make ~25–35¢ per reader/mo (assuming $30 CPMs, 40% open rate, 25 sends a month). So every reader The Rundown acquires is ~2x more valuable. This is because instead of focusing on lowering CPLs, they’re focusing on maximizing reader LTV. A big part of that LTV is The Rundown AI University, a $1,000/yr AI program with workshops, guides, and certifications. It’s approaching 50% of revenue (my estimate is ~$4M ARR in ~18 months). That cash flow lets them outspend everyone on quality subscribers. Here are the 3 levers that make the LTV engine work: 1. Growth: Two things that helped TRAI: a) Organic growth Rowan’s (founder of TRAI) organic posts drove 100,000+ readers with 40%+ open rates, 12%+ CTRs. His content pillars: • Event recaps (e.g., CES event coverage) • Feature walk-throughs (sharing how to use Apple’s AI features) • News recaps (talking about Brett Adcock’s latest AI lab) And it worked: • 1 B+ impressions on X in year one • Trust from readers • Earned access that few have (interviewing Zuckerberg and Sam Altman) b) Aggressive paid growth They’ve spent upwards of ~$200k/mo on paid growth. This only works because of the flywheel: $1,000/yr product → cash upfront → reinvest in ads → acquire high-quality readers who later buy → repeat. 2. Funnels How they move someone from reader to buyer: a) Personalized onboarding quiz New subscribers answer questions about: • Their role (marketer, engineer, etc.) • Skill level • What they want to learn Then they land on a page tailored to them with recommended workflows and tools. b) Email nurture Beyond the daily newsletter, they send workshop previews (”Learn ChatGPT tips”) and workflow examples (”how to build an AI email agent”). c) In-newsletter promotion Bottom-third modules consistently spotlight previous live workshops and guides. TRAI also sells deep-dive sponsorship offers. Assuming they charge $60K/slot and send two deep-dives per month, that’s $1.5M/yr. 3. AI as leverage, not replacement TRAI has ~15 people producing the output of a 30-person media team. Examples: a) AI video avatars The TRAI team takes Rowan's written content (newsletter/X), writes scripts, feeds them into HeyGen and ElevenLabs, and builds Reels using his voice and AI avatar. It still takes ~4 hours per reel, but Rowan doesn’t have to be in the studio. b) Lindy for meeting scheduling Lindy reads sponsor emails, understands context, checks calendars, replies like a human, and books meetings directly. That alone saves 5–10 hours/week and removes friction for high-value sponsors c) Claude as editor The team writes the full newsletter manually. Then they load it into a Claude thread trained on their best issues to tighten and polish.\",\n    \"author\": \"@_May_Ham\",\n    \"date\": \"2026-01-08\",\n    \"likes\": 3,\n    \"commercial_type\": \"income_report, course_selling, sponsorship\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"I generate $400,000/year with a paid newsletter on Substack:  • I don't run ads • It took 578 days • It has 65,000+ subscribers This is the most scalable (and profitable) business I've ever seen.

Hear me out, I speak from experience. I launched The Web3 + AI Newsletter over two years ago, and since then, I've tried out various publishing schedules, monetization methods, and newsletter and social media platforms. Something was always missing - either the exposure and community-building features were seriously lacking, or the subscription methods didn't fit my objectives, or the UX with donation operators left a lot to be desired. Only after migrating my publication to the Web3 platform @paragraph_xyz, do I feel like I'm on the right path. It guarantees me: 💡 Full editorial autonomy and independence 📃 Secure archiving by recording every single post on the Arweave permissionless database 💸 Fair monetization system where I earn together with my readers. 🗝️ This last point is the key, though. Web3, through tools like social tokens, empowers me to share my success with everyone who has supported me along the way - something that I wouldn't have been able to do in Web2. Today, I'm excited to announce the launch of my writer token $WEB3AI and my creator token $ALBENA 🥳  They enable my community to back me as an author if my Web3 + AI writing resonates with them, or generally as a creator across platforms, genres, and formats. And more importantly, they empower my audience to bag rewards as I grow and evolve as a creator. Web3 lets me build my own miniature economy, where as my popularity and readership grow, the value of my tokens grows with them. My influence is automatically turned into equity, without depending on a specific platform.  Of course, this is all just an experiment for now, but I'm happy to share it with you and bring you along for the journey.  My latest article outlines all the details 👇Check it out and share your thoughts. Do you agree that we're on the verge of a new era for creative writing, journalism, and blogging thanks to Web3? https://t.co/cAkIYiLLMU\",\n    \"author\": \"@Albena_Kostova\",\n    \"date\": \"2026-01-21\",\n    \"likes\": 1,\n    \"commercial_type\": \"monetization, token\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"A lot of people ask how I make money on X and how they can do the same Over the past 2 years I’ve gone from 0 to 170,000 followers and $248,290 of revenue This post isn’t to gloat, it's to show you how you can make $ on X too 2023 X Revenue: X Consulting: $102,000 X Ad Share: $5,387 X Subscriptions: $2,703 Newsletter sponsorships: $53,000 Premium newsletter (1% Club): $31,000 Courses: $51,000 Affiliate links in newsletter: $3,200 How you can start making money in each: 🔶Consulting What’s your one skill where you are ahead of 50% of people? You don’t even need to be in the top 1%. Just ahead of most. Once you’ve figured out that skill, create a base of content to prove your authority in that field From there, offer your services for free until you get a bite. Get a testimonial, charge a little more Rinse and repeat 🔶Ad Share Only two ways to get paid: • Impressions on your profile • Impressions on the reply section of your posts That’s it. The stolen memes you’re spamming to Elon aren’t making you a cent. Create content that spurs conversation. This is by far the best way to generate impressions that earn you revenue 🔶 X Subscriptions Turn on the subscription button. Everyone should do this. Offer something special. For me, I offer subscriber only Spaces every week It's an opportunity for people to chat with me and ask questions Amazing for building closer relationships and build knowledge as a community By far my favorite couple hours of the week 🔶Newsletter Sponsorships Have a newsletter? You can sell sponsorships no matter what your size Reach out to projects in your niche Offer them a sponsored spot for a small fee If you want, you can offer an affiliate deal where you get paid for every click If you find the right projects that align perfectly with your niche, you’ll be able to make money even when you’re small 🔶Premium newsletter Turn on the premium newsletter option in your provider Offer something special for the premium tier For me, that’s a bonus AI newsletter every Saturday plus a private community where you can chat with me every day of the week 🔶Courses Run your consulting business for a few months Learn about client challenges Take those challenges, make content out of it Take that content, record yourself going over it You now have a course For cheap, you can sell it on Notion. For a little money, you can sell it on Kajabi My course was on Kajabi 🔶 Affiliate links: Tons of software tools offer affiliate programs in order to get the word out about their product I have affiliate links for X tools in my newsletters Find tools that align with your niche and offer them in your content Easy, passive income 🔶🔶🔶 This took me 20 months to get to this point, but my first $1 was made 10 months in With enough consistency and targeted effort, I promise you can achieve this too Get to building\",\n    \"author\": \"@AlexFinn\",\n    \"date\": \"2023-10-22\",\n    \"likes\": 886,\n    \"commercial_type\": \"income_report, sponsorship, affiliate, course_selling\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Six months ago I discovered a business model that's made me about $500k so far, and I'm gonna explain exactly how it works because almost nobody outside of a small circle knows this exists. It's newsletters, but not the way you think. Basically, when someone subscribes to your newsletter, they immediately see a popup with other newsletters they can join with one click. And those newsletters are paying you one to four dollars per subscriber through platforms like Beehiiv Boosts and SparkLoop. So I signed up for Beehiiv, picked finance as my niche because I knew a little bit about investing, created a simple landing page that said get my free weekly finance newsletter alongside a lead magnet, and I started posting content on Instagram and TikTok driving people to that page. First month I got about 1500 subscribers organically, didn't spend a single dollar on ads. And I made about $2K just from those people subscribing through those recommendation payouts. I hadn't even sent them an email yet Then the upcoming months I started getting into FB ads. I wasn't profitable INSTANTLY because I was paying more per subscriber than what the newsletters were paying me, but eventually I became profitable by selling them my own products. And here's how I make money now. Pay per sub, sponsors (about $30 CPM), and then my own products, I have a main course, a few smaller guides, and a SaaS.  And tbh this isn't even optimized yet. I'm still learning, still testing, still scaling. If I focused on just one newsletter and really dialed in I could probably triple this. But the model works, it's proven, it's profitable, and possibly one of the easiest models to start because you don't need to sell anything to get paid.\",\n    \"author\": \"@micahhcole\",\n    \"date\": \"2025-12-19\",\n    \"likes\": 464,\n    \"commercial_type\": \"income_report, sponsorship, course_selling, affiliate\"\n  }\n]"
